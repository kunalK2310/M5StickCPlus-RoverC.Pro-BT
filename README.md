# M5StickCPlus-RoverC.Pro Bluetooth
This code is designed for the M5Stack's StickCPlus module, paired with the RoverC.Pro module, to control a four-wheeled robot via Bluetooth. It sends serial data to adjust the robot's movement. The code calculates the speed for each of the four motors to direct the rover in a specified direction at a desired speed. Directions are defined by angles: 0 degrees moves the rover forward, 90 degrees to the right, 180 degrees backwards, and 45 degrees in a diagonal right forward direction. Speed settings range from +100, indicating maximum speed forward, to -100, which is maximum speed backwards.
